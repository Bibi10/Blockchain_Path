## TECHNOLOGY

I - Blockchain Technology review

- Distributed Ledger

A Distributed Ledger is a storage tool that is shared and synchonised across multiple party.It make an information available for any node of the network .

- Consensus Mechanism
  Its a fault taulerant mechanism that is used in blockchain system to achieve necessary agreement on a state of the network among distributed process.

- Mining
  Mining process involve solving complex mathematical problem using intrinsec hash fonctions linked to the block containing transaction data.Miners compete with each other to be the first to solve the mathematical puzzle.

- Public & Private blockchain
  There are different types of Blockchain :

- DL Platforms : 

II - Blockchain Primitives

- Crypographic Hash Functions

![alt text](https://github.com/Bibi10/Blockchain_Path/blob/master/CFunc.png 'Crypto')

Its a hash function use in cryptography which take an input and returns a fixed-size string of bytes.
The string is called the 'hash value', 'message digest', 'digital fingerprint', 'digest' or 'checksum'.

- Public Key Cryptography
  Public-Key Cryptography or asymetric cryptography, is a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys(public and private) algorithm to secure data communication.

- Merkle Trees

![alt text](https://github.com/Bibi10/Blockchain_Path/blob/master/Mtree.png 'Tree')

Also called hash tree, is a tree in which every leaf node is labelled with the hash of a data block.

- Block
  ![alt text](https://github.com/Bibi10/Blockchain_Path/blob/master/Block.png 'Block')
  A block contains the set of valid unicode and hash transactions according to the laws of the blockchain.

- Blockchain Structure

- Building Blockchain

- Smart Contracts
  A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between two parties being directly written into lines of code.

- Nodes
  The nodes are the administrative body of the blockchain and verify the legitimacy of the transactions in each block.



- Blockchain Forks
  ![alt text](https://github.com/Bibi10/Blockchain_Path/blob/master/Fork.png 'Fork')

A fork is defined variously as: "what happens when a blockchain diverges into two potential paths forward" "a change in protocol" or a situation that "occurs when two or more blocks have the same block height" .

III - Ethereum Basics

- What is Ethereum 
Launched in 2015, Ethereum is the world open source blockchain platform that enables developper to build Decentralized Applications.
While providing high availability, auditability, transparency, and neutrality, it also reduces or eliminates censorship and reduces certain counterparty risks.
Like other blockchains, Ethereum has a native cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH). ETH is digital money. If you’ve heard of Bitcoin, ETH has many of the same features. It is purely digital, and can be sent to anyone anywhere in the world instantly. The supply of ETH isn’t controlled by any government or company - it is decentralized, and it is scarce. People all over the world use ETH to make payments, as a store of value, or as collateral.

The Ethereum system is comprised of :

- Accounts
Ethereum is comprised of objects with 20 byte address that interact with one another,its called an account.
There are two types of account :
Externally  Owned Account and Contract account
Extrenal account are controlled by private keys with no code associated to.
Contract accounts are controlled by their contract code and have code associated with them.

- Transactions
Every interractions in ethereum are transactions between  accounts.

- Gas 
Gas is the amount of ETH used to pay for a transaction in the network and its measured in WEI, where 1ETH is 1⁰¹⁸ Wei.

- Tokens 
Tokens are used to incentivize interrraction with a protocol.
There are many type of token standar due to people creating their own.
Exemple : ER223, 777, 827, 721..
