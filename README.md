A Distributed Ledger is a storage tool that is shared and synchonised across multiple party.It make an information available for any node of the network .

- Consensus Mechanism
  Its a fault taulerant mechanism that is used in blockchain system to achieve necessary agreement on a state of the network among distributed process.

- Mining
  Mining process involve solving complex mathematical problem using intrinsec hash fonctions linked to the block containing transaction data.Miners compete with each other to be the first to solve the mathematical puzzle.

- Public & Private blockchain
  There are different types of Blockchain :
