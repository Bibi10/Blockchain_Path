I - Blockchain Technology review

- Distributed Ledger

A Distributed Ledger is a storage tool that is shared and synchonised across multiple party.It make an information available for any node of the network .

- Consensus Mechanism
  Its a fault taulerant mechanism that is used in blockchain system to achieve necessary agreement on a state of the network among distributed process.

- Mining
  Mining process involve solving complex mathematical problem using intrinsec hash fonctions linked to the block containing transaction data.Miners compete with each other to be the first to solve the mathematical puzzle.

- Public & Private blockchain
  There are different types of Blockchain :

- DL Platforms : 

II - Blockchain Primitives

- Crypographic Hash Functions

![alt text](https://github.com/Bibi10/Blockchain_Path/blob/master/CFunc.png 'Crypto')

Its a hash function use in cryptography which take an input and returns a fixed-size string of bytes.
The string is called the 'hash value', 'message digest', 'digital fingerprint', 'digest' or 'checksum'.

- Public Key Cryptography
  Public-Key Cryptography or asymetric cryptography, is a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys(public and private) algorithm to secure data communication.

- Merkle Trees

![alt text](https://github.com/Bibi10/Blockchain_Path/blob/master/Mtree.png 'Tree')

Also called hash tree, is a tree in which every leaf node is labelled with the hash of a data block.

- Block
  ![alt text](https://github.com/Bibi10/Blockchain_Path/blob/master/Block.png 'Block')
  A block contains the set of valid unicode and hash transactions according to the laws of the blockchain.

- Blockchain Structure

- Building Blockchain

- Smart Contracts
  A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between two parties being directly written into lines of code.

- Nodes
  The nodes are the administrative body of the blockchain and verify the legitimacy of the transactions in each block.

- Blockchain Forks
  ![alt text](https://github.com/Bibi10/Blockchain_Path/blob/master/Fork.png 'Fork')

A fork is defined variously as: "what happens when a blockchain diverges into two potential paths forward" "a change in protocol" or a situation that "occurs when two or more blocks have the same block height" .
